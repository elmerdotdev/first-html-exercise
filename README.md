## Create navigation between files

Create a new project containing:

- 2 files in the root directory (index.html and contact.html)
- 1 directory named `files`:
  - Add 2 images of your choice and 1 file named `images.html` that will list these 2 images
- Inside of each `.html` file:
  - create a navigation menu `nav` that will allow you to navigate between the files, using an unordered list `ul` and anchor tags `a` with the name of the page.
  - Title `h1` of the page
  - One or more paragraphs of text, with page information. You can use [lorem ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) to generate dummy text.

  - LinkedIn
  - Email
  - Phone
  - _Not required_ - You can use icons aside the text for the links.
